    <h2>Camera Services</h2>
    <p>
      Video cameras have become one of the most valuable tools in the
      plumbing industry. Technology has evolved to create waterproof
      cameras that can provide visual inspections of plumbing that
      can’t be reached by a technician on their own. The flexible rod
      allows the camera to travel through the pipe and around corners
      to see the pipe in its entirety. Real-time video transmission
      provides our technician with a look at the condition of your
      pipes and can locate specific problems quickly.

    <h2>Hydro Jetting</h2>
    <p>
      Hydro jetting is a method used by Mars Services to clean clogged or slow sewage lines. A blast of water at high pressure is sent into the lines that will usually remove blockages and build up. Hydro jetting systems normally use about 4000 psi, which works very effectively.

      A video inspection should be performed first to determine the cause and location of the problem. If tree roots are a problem, the high pressure should cut through them. However, a snake may need to be used first to tear up heavy roots. Hydro jetting will not solve problems with broken pipes and could cause weakened areas to break. In addition, a video inspection can reduce the possibility of sewage back flushing into other areas.

      What can be removed with hydro jetting?
    </p>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>For residential work, hydro jetting can remove sand, silt and scale build up as well as hair clogs and other residues that build up on the walls of the pipes.</li>
        <li>Routine hydro jetting should be done on restaurants to remove grease and food particle build up. This type of service can completely clean pipes of residual build up in ways that snaking can not. Snaking out pipes only breaks up the clogs but leaves build up remaining on the interior walls.</li>
        <li>Hydro jetting is also environmentally friendly, no harsh chemicals are needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <p>
      While hydro jetting is frequently used in commercial plumbing, it can be extremely beneficial to homeowners. If you need to have your plumbing snaked on a regular basis a hydro jetting service will eliminate all the debris in the lines. The service can greatly improve older plumbing lines that have years of build up. It is also particularly useful for homeowners that experience sand and silt build up as chemical cleaners and augers will not flush the system completely.
